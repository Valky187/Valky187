# 👋 Hi, I'm Michaela M. — Automation & AI Explorer

I’m not your typical developer.  
I come from the world of sales and business strategy — and I chose to step into the world of tech because I believe we’re standing at the edge of a new era.  

Just like during the Industrial Revolution, those who embrace change will lead, and those who don’t… will be left behind.

💡 My mission? To make sure **people work less like robots — and robots work more like people.**  
Automation isn’t about replacing humans; it’s about giving us back our time, creativity, and freedom.

## 🚀 What I Do

🧠 **Automation & AI Specialist** – I design workflows that turn complex business operations into seamless, automated systems.  
🔌 **Bridge Between Worlds** – I translate business needs into technical solutions (and vice versa).  
🌍 **Explorer** – I experiment with tools, APIs, and AI to understand what’s possible and push those boundaries further.

I’m passionate about designing solutions that simplify processes, eliminate repetitive tasks, and unlock new opportunities — because that’s how businesses stay ahead.

## 🌱 My Journey

I left a stable sales career to dive into tech — a world full of brilliant geeks and confident business leaders — because I knew this was where I belonged.  

I’m not a senior engineer. I’m not a „clicker“ or a „code banger.“  
I’m a **fast learner, a systems thinker, and a visionary** who believes that the future belongs to those who connect technology with real human needs.

I see automation and AI as the next industrial revolution — and I want to be part of the generation that builds the foundation for it.
