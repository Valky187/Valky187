## 💡 My Mission

**To make sure people work less like robots — and robots work more like people.**

I'm not your typical developer.  
I come from the world of **sales and business strategy** — and I chose to step into the world of tech because I believe we're standing at the edge of a new era.

Just like during the Industrial Revolution, those who embrace change will lead, and those who don't… will be left behind.

Automation isn't about replacing humans; it's about giving us back our **time, creativity, and freedom**.

## 🚀 What I Do

🧠 **Automation & AI Specialist** – I design workflows that turn complex business operations into seamless, automated systems.

🔌 **Bridge Between Worlds** – I translate business needs into technical solutions (and vice versa).

🌍 **Explorer** – I experiment with tools, APIs, and AI to understand what's possible and push those boundaries further.

I'm passionate about designing solutions that simplify processes, eliminate repetitive tasks, and unlock new opportunities — because that's how businesses stay ahead.

## 🌱 My Journey

I left a stable sales career to dive into tech — a world full of brilliant geeks and confident business leaders — because I knew this was where I belonged.

I'm not a senior engineer. I'm not a "clicker" or a "code banger."

I'm a **fast learner, a systems thinker, and a visionary** who believes that the future belongs to those who connect technology with real human needs.

I see automation and AI as the next industrial revolution — and I want to be part of the generation that builds the foundation for it.
